# How to add an object to Vicon Tracker
One key thing to note is that your object should be rigid and also have at least three asymmetrical arrangement of markers on it.

- Start by pausing the stream from the Objects tab.
- Mark your object with at least three 3 markers (CCAM has a couple of X base markers and velcro to attach to objects, ask the technical manager for access)
- Position your object in the space
- Unpause the stream to see the markers in the view pane
- Select all the markers. You can easily do this by holding the alt-key and dragging around the markers to select them.
- Name the object in the Create Object box in the bottom left of the application window and hit create to add the object
- The object would be added the object list on the left side pane of the application.

If you can't see your object, check to make sure it is checked in the object list.
